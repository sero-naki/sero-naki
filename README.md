# 👾 Hey, I’m ✨ Sero!  

## 🚀 Crafting Code & Tinkering with Ideas  

- 🔹 **Builder of weird & useful things** – From browser extensions to micro-SaaS tools, I love turning ideas into reality.  
- 🔹 **Automation nerd** – If something can be automated, I’ll probably try to build an API for it.  
- 🔹 **Lover of browser tech** – Chrome extensions, web scrapers, and anything that makes the internet more fun to mess with.  

## 🛠️ What I’m Cooking Up  
🔥 **Currently working on:** A **Bulk Screenshot & Archive API** – because manually taking website screenshots is for peasants.  
💡 **Exploring new micro-SaaS ideas**, mostly for **developers & automation lovers**.  

## 🤝 Let’s Connect  
👀 Always open to collaborations on dev tools, APIs, and browser-based projects.  
💬 **DM me** about automation, web scraping, or why JavaScript is a love-hate relationship.

🚀 _Always building, always experimenting!_
